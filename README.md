## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt the use of the list-style-image property. It allows for images to be used as list-item markers.

```css
ul {
	list-style-image: url(icon-list.svg);
}
```

### Continued development

I am still improving my understanding of media queries. Additionally, reusability of CSS custom properties are a challenge. Currently, I store the fixed structure of CSS property value pairs which I reuse for each project. In due time, I strive to generate a comprehensive reusable CSS file.
